  The strongest earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude 9.5 event that struck
  off the coast of Chile on May 22, 1960, commonly known as the Great Chilean or
  Valdivia earthquake. It was a megathrust earthquake caused by the subduction
  of the Nazca plate under the South American plate. The event triggered a
  massive Pacific-wide tsunami that caused significant damage and loss of life
  in places as far away as Hawaii and Japan
